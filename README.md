<h1>Figment.observer</h1>
<a href="http://figment.observer" target="_blank">Figment.observer</a> is a character sketch platform for creative writing vignettes in under 2000 characters. It was born out of a desire to see collaborative creative writing on a mobile-first, highly visual blog.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
To get this running locally on your machine, clone the repo, `cd` into it, and `npm i` all of the dependencies. Spin up a local server and make sure your configuration matches the config.JSON file. You will also need to set up a local database named figment_db and run it in order to add and update data.
